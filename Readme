Title: Groundfish with diverse life histories increase in size and abundance with proximity to spatial protections

Abstract: Marine protected areas (MPAs) have long been used to conserve and recover depleted marine ecosystems, including marine fishes. Whether MPAs provide benefits to local fish and fisheries (via spillover effects) remains uncertain. Yet, documenting spillover benefits is key to informing decision making for marine conservation and fisheries management. Here, we leverage a novel and extensive dataset from the Central Coast First Nations of a diverse assemblage of groundfish species to quantify the benefits of a suite of MPAs implemented in Pacific Canada, known as Rockfish Conservation Areas (RCAs). In general, we found that proximity to RCAs increased the body sizes and abundances of groundfish species with positive effects documented in 89% and 35% of species-RCA combinations, respectively. The benefits of spatial protection varied by species’ pace of life, location, and historical impacts from commercial fishing, but benefits consistently increased over time since RCAs were implemented.
